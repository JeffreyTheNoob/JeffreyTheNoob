- 👋 Hi, I’m @JeffreyTheNoob 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Arduino and Raspberry PI to create and utilizie some home automation devices and some projects with 
      camera and streaming. This will grow into more interest as I learn and grow I am certain. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get started with building a FM radio with long range bluetooth capabilites simply for cutting my grass while listening to my favorite radio 
       station through my bluetooth earbuds without loosing signal. I can simply stream it from my phone on my side but it would be good to save the battery on that and connect 
       to the phone and radio both while working outside. That way I don't miss a call while enjoying my music. Any help would be great since I am a noob. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
